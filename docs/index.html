<p>You have just moved into The Vanderwich Estate.</p>
<p>You spend the rest of the morning unloading your boxes of belongings.</p>
<p>Tired, you decide to take a break by going for a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#window">You look out of the window.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="window"></a></p>
<p>The sun is shining warmly, but grey clouds are looming in a distance.</p>
<p>You bring your…</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Puppy</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Umbrella</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Purse</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="2"></a></p>
<p>While walking, you noticed your next door neighbour watering his plants at his front porch.</p>
<p>He looks a little grizzled, but he seems to have an friendly demeanour.</p>
<p>He notices you looking over.</p>
<p>He smiles and waves.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#3">Smile brightly and wave back with great enthusiasm</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Fidget awkwardly then nod your head in acknowledgement</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="3"></a></p>
<p>You approached him and found that he had a small shack at his front porch beside his mini garden.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#4">“You really love gardening don’t you?”</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">”Nice day out here huh?”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="4"></a></p>
<p>He turned and looked at his masterpiece and smiled.</p>
<p>Removing his right glove, he raised his right hand.</p>
<p>“The name’s Ming, nice to meet you. You’re new here aren’t you? Just moved in?”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#5">You gently shake his hand.</a></li>
</ul>
