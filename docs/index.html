<p>You have just moved into The Janus Estate.</p>
<p>Land here is cheap and it is rumored to be quiet around here, much to your taste.</p>
<p>You spend the rest of the morning unloading your boxes of belongings.</p>
<p>Tired, you decide to take a break by going for a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#1">Look out of the window. | You look out of the window.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="1"></a></p>
<p>The sun is shining warmly, but grey clouds are looming in a distance.</p>
<p>You bring your…</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Cellphone | You bring your cellphone.</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Umbrella | You bring your umbrella.</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Purse | You bring your purse.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="2"></a></p>
<p>While walking, you spot your neighbour watering his plants at his front porch.</p>
<p>He looks a little grizzled, but he seems to have a friendly demeanour.</p>
<p>He notices you looking over.</p>
<p>He smiles and waves.</p>
<p>You...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#3">Smile brightly and wave back with great enthusiasm | You smile brightly and wave back with great enthusiasm.</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Fidget awkwardly and nod your head in acknowledgement | You fidget awkwardly and nod your head in acknowledgement.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="3"></a></p>
<p>You approach him and find that he has a small shack at his front porch, beside his mini garden.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#4">“You really do love gardening, don’t you?” | “You really do love gardening, don’t you?” you pointed out.</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">“Nice day out here, huh?” | “Nice day out here, huh?” you remarked.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="4"></a></p>
<p>He turns and looks at his masterpiece and smiles.</p>
<p>He raises his right hand towards you.</p>
<p>“The name’s Ming, nice to meet you. You’re new here aren’t you? Just moved in?” Ming said.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#5">Gently shake his hand. | You gently shake his hand.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="5"></a></p>
<p>“Yeah, just finished unloading all the boxes from my truck this morning.&quot; you replied.</p>
<p>“I see. Need any help?&quot;</p>
<p>“I’ve got some time to spare before I settle some matters later.” He chuckled.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#6">“Yes please! That would be very nice of you.” | “Yes please! That would be very nice of you.” you said.</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">“Nahh, I’m fine for now. Thank you for the offer!” | “Nahh, I’m fine for now. Thank you for the offer!” you said.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="6"></a></p>
<p>“Hey you know what, why not you come over for dinner tonight?”</p>
<p>“I’ve went to culinary school over the summer and created this new technique myself.</p>
<p>“I would <em>love</em> to have you try it.” Ming said.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#6.1">Accept his invitation. | “Sounds great! I look forward to the dinner tonight.”</a></li>
<li><a href="#6.2">Accept but tell him you cannot stay for long. | “Sounds great! I look forward to the dinner tonight, but I cannot stay for long because I need to take care of my puppy... It’s sick.”</a></li>
<li><a href="#6.3">Reject his invitation. | “I’m sorry but I'm not free tonight. How about some other time?”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="6.1"></a></p>
<p>“Awesome! See you in a bit!” Ming said cheerily.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#6.5">Continue | Night falls and you make your way over to Ming’s place.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="6.2"></a></p>
<p>“Awesome! Oh dear, that poor thing. No worries, see you in a bit!”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#6.5">Continue | Night falls and you make your way over to Ming’s place.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="6.3"></a></p>
<p>“Oh what a shame. How about you try one right now? It’ll not take too long, I promise.”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#6.31">Accept his invitation | “Sounds great!”</a></li>
<li><a href="#6.32">Accept but tell him you cannot stay for long. | “Sounds great! I look forward to the dinner tonight, but I cannot stay for long because I need to take care of my puppy... It’s sick.”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="6.31"></a></p>
<p>“Awesome! Come on in!”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#7">Continue | “Please make yourself at home! Let me bring out the dish.”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="6.32"></a></p>
<p>“Oh dear, that poor thing. No worries, come on in!”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#7">Continue | “Please make yourself at home! Let me bring out the dish.”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="6.5"></a></p>
<p>You knock on his door and he lets you in.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#7">Step in | “Please make yourself at home! Let me bring out the dish.”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="7"></a></p>
<p>Ming disappears into the kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#8">Take a seat. | You take a seat at the dining table.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="8"></a></p>
<p>After a while, he emerges from the kitchen and presents upon you the delicacy:</p>
<p>It is his signature homemade Ang Ku Kueh.</p>
<p>“Here you go, hope it suits your taste! I dare say it is my <em>magnum opus</em> in culinary terms.”</p>
<p>You look down onto the dish.</p>
<p>It is redder than usual – almost blood red – and has a strong aroma.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#9">Take a bite. | You take a bite.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="9"></a></p>
<p>You find it to be savoury with a fragrant aftertaste, unlike any Ang Ku Kueh you have eaten before.</p>
<p>The taste is amazing to say the least.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#9.1">Take another bite | You take another bite.</a></li>
<li><a href="#10">Ask Ming for the recipe. | You ask Ming for the recipe.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="9.1"></a></p>
<p>The next bite does not dull the taste nor tire your palate.</p>
<p>In fact, it made the taste even deeper and enriching.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#9.1">Take another bite. | You take another bite.</a></li>
<li><a href="#10">Ask Ming for the recipe. | You ask Ming for the recipe.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="10"></a></p>
<p>“This Ang Ku Kueh tastes amazing! What is your recipe for this? I <em>have</em> to have it.”</p>
<p>You immediately notice a slight readjustment in Ming’s posture.</p>
<p>Cracking a smile, he beckons you to follow him.</p>
<p>“Come, let me show you something.”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#11">Follow him. | You follow him.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="11"></a></p>
<p>You and Ming make your way up a flight of stairs and reach a corridor.</p>
<p>You start hearing whimpers of small animals and smell a pungent stench, growing louder and stronger with every step you take.</p>
<p>You are feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>At the end of the corridor, Ming opens the door and gestures you in.</p>
<p>He stops suddenly.</p>
<p>“Ah, I forgot to turn off the microwave! Stay here for a while, I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>He leaves you alone.</p>
<p>The room in front of you is dimly lit.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#12">Step in. | You step in.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="12"></a></p>
<p>The air reeks of thick ozone and iron.</p>
<p>The whimpers you previously heard have now grown sharper into a grotesque symphony, almost as if your entrance has disturbed whatever is making the sounds.</p>
<p>Most hauntingly, what seems like an operation table lies in the centre of the room.</p>
<p>You gasp in horror as you try to compose yourself.</p>
<p>As you approach the table, you notice a tray of dirty tools right beside the table.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#12.1">Inspect the operation table. | You approach the operation table.</a></li>
<li><a href="#12.2">Inspect the tools. | You approach the tools.</a></li>
<li><a href="#12.3">Inspect surroundings. | You survey your surroundings.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="12.1"></a></p>
<p>The table surface looks abused with blunt forces and knife marks.</p>
<p>A red stain on the table catches your eye.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#12.2">Inspect the tools. | You approach the tools.</a></li>
<li><a href="#12.3">Inspect surroundings. | You survey your surroundings.</a></li>
<li><a href="#13">Go back to the door. | You go back to the door.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="12.2"></a></p>
<p>You see a knife, a rubber tube, a syringe, a hammer and several empty glass vials.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#12.1">Inspect the operation table. | You approach the operation table.</a></li>
<li><a href="#12.3">Inspect surroundings. | You survey your surroundings.</a></li>
<li><a href="#13">Go back to the door. | You go back to the door.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="12.3"></a></p>
<p>The room is small and seems to be cramped with all sorts of equipment.</p>
<p>An old flood light hangs from the ceiling, shallowly illuminating the surroundings.</p>
<p>You barely make out a row of rusty metal cages neatly organised and aligned against the left wall of the room.</p>
<p>Jars of dark liquid lie on the opposite side; they are labelled with varying dates.</p>
<p>You…</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#12.1">Inspect the operation table. | You approach the operation table.</a></li>
<li><a href="#12.2">Inspect the tools. | You approach the tools.</a></li>
<li><a href="#13">Go back to the door. | You go back to the door.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="13"></a></p>
<p>“What’s all this…” you whispered under your breath.</p>
<p>Ming enters the room.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#14">“What <em>is</em> this place?!” | “What <em>is</em> this place?!” you blurted out.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="14"></a></p>
<p>He notices the seriousness of your voice.</p>
<p>“Can’t you see? This is where the Ang Ku Kuehs are made to taste so good!”</p>
<p>He lets out a nervous laugh, in an attempt to lighten the mood.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#15">“This looks more like a laboratory! What’s going on here?”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="15"></a></p>
<p>You raised your voice but it quivered in uncertainty of what follows.</p>
<p>Ming moves in closer.</p>
<p>“Please keep calm. I understand that this is not the ideal situation you would like to find yourself in.”</p>
<p>“I respect that your decision if you feel uncomfortable and would like to leave.”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#16">“Tell me what’s happening in this room right now before I call the police.” | “Tell me what’s happening in this room right now before I call the police.” you threatened.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="16"></a></p>
<p>“Okay, let’s not get hasty… in all honesty, what makes the Ang Ku Kueh extra tasty is due to a secret ingredient:</p>
<p>Angkumone.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#17">“Angkumone?!”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="17"></a></p>
<p>“Yes, Angkumone. It is a chemical that adds that distinctive flavour which you have tasted in the Ang Ku Kueh, as well as giving it its luscious colour of red.” Ming explained.</p>
<p>“However, it can only be produced in the brains of... <em>puppies</em> after they have been physically and psychologically tormented over a long period of time.”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#18">“What?”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="18"></a></p>
<p>“Yes. When a puppy has reached the ripe age for harvesting, I will deal a traumatizing blow to the puppy’s head to kill it.” he paused.</p>
<p>“Only such trauma can allow the Angkumone to fully mature into its richest taste within the puppy’s brain.”</p>
<p>You took a step back and paused for a moment to recollect your thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#19">“Wha…. What on earth?”</a></li>
<li><a href="#19">“No wonder! It tasted amazing! Very interesting recipe you got there.”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="19"></a></p>
<p>“Would you like to have another one?” Ming asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#20">“What?! You are inhumane, and there is no way I’m having another!”</a></li>
<li><a href="#21">“If you don’t mind! Pack me some to bring home too please!”</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="21"></a></p>
<p>You and Ming move to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Ming happily packs some of the leftover Ang Ku Kuehs for you.</p>
<p>“Be right back!” he says, before slipping out of the kitchen.</p>
<p><em>THUMP! THUMP!</em></p>
<p>You hear the shrill whimper ring through the house before silence fell again.</p>
<p>Ming steps back in and hands you a small jar with red liquid.</p>
<p>“I’m happy that you understand why I’m doing this, here - a jar of fresh Angkumone on the house!”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#22">Take the jar. | You take the jar.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="22"></a></p>
<p>“Thank you for the hospitality Ming, see you soon!”</p>
<p>You left the house.</p>
<p>On the way home, each time you looked the jar, you felt the weight increase in your hands.</p>
<p>You reached home safely.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#22.1">Pour yourself a glass of water. | You pour yourself a glass of water.</a></li>
<li><a href="#22.2">Put on the television. | You put on the television.</a></li>
<li><a href="#22.3">Turn on your laptop. | You turn on your laptop.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="20"></a></p>
<p>You reject Ming’s offer.</p>
<p>You leave his house and scurry home feeling utterly disgusted with the experience.</p>
<p>On the way home, you thought to yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#20.1">Who am I to make a difference? | <em>Who am I to make a difference?</em></a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a name="20.1"></a></p>
<p><em>Even if I choose not to eat the Ang Ku Kueh that is made with Angkumone, Ming will not be discouraged from torturing the puppies in that room…</em></p>
<p>Making your way along the pavement, each step you take grows heavier in weight.</p>
<p>You reach home safely.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#22.1">Pour yourself a glass of water. | You pour yourself a glass of water.</a></li>
<li><a href="#22.2">Put on the television. | You put on the television.</a></li>

<p><a name="22.2"></a></p>
<p>You switch on the television and coincidentally, the Discovery Channel is on.</p>
<p>You fiddle with the bunch of magazines on the coffee table to distract yourself from the events at Ming’s house.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you hear the familiar whimpers through the television screen and look over.</p>
<p><em>It is a documentary on factory-farmed animals.</em></p>
<p>What was happening through the screen was like an <strong>exact</strong> replay of the earlier situation at Ming’s house:</p>
<p>Just that chickens and pigs took the places of the puppies.</p>
<p>The factory animals had no freedom and were treated in ways that were almost unimaginable.</p>
<p>You notice the parallel between the situation on screen and that in Ming’s house.</p>
<p>You thought to yourself…</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#23">Regardless of puppies or factory farmed animals, they are no different from each other... | <em>Regardless of puppies or factory farmed animals, they are no different from each other...</em></a></li>

<p><a name="22.3"></a></p>
<p>You switch on your laptop and plug in your earphones.</p>
<p>“....Youtube..dot..com”</p>
<p>You mouth to yourself as you punch the letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Something catches your attention at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#22.31">Click on video. | You click on the video.</a></li>

<p><a name="22.31"></a></p>

<p>According to a philosopher named Loren Lomansky, pleasure is all that matters for non-human animals.</p>
<p>It seems that most factory-farmed animals experience more pleasure than pain in their lives, thus they generate lives worth living.</p>

<p>You open your eyes.</p>

<p>Your sense of time is skewed; you do not know how long you have been here.</p>
<p><em>Is this even real?</em> you thought to yourself.</p>
<p>You waited and waited.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you hear the door creak open.</p>
<p>A dim light is switched on and your vision readjusts.</p>

<p>There are familiar-looking jars of red liquid on the opposite side of the room.</p>
<p>You see cages around you but you do not see any puppies:</p>
<p>You see humans instead.</p>
<p>Their eyes look soulless and have a blank expression on their face.</p>
<p>Some are salivating and groaning as they lean against the bars of the cage.</p>
<p>They looked like they have not cleaned themselves nor eaten for a long time.</p>

<p>“You were so humorous earlier on today, believing that I kept puppies to harvest Angkumone.”</p>
<p>“I am running out of ideas though: I have already lied about kittens, rabbits and even hamsters for the previous neighbours in the Estate.” He chuckled.</p>
<p>He pauses and looks at the humans in the other cages.</p>
<p>“They always believe me.”</p>
<p>Ming leans in closer.</p>
<p>“I am not from around here you see - oh no, not the Estate per se, silly.”</p>

<p>“I <em>literally</em> am not from this world.”</p>
<p>“I just really, <em>really</em> like to eat Ang Ku Kueh made with Angkumone.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I won’t harvest you that soon, silly human.”</p>
<p>“Your turn will come soon.” he winked.</p>
<p>Ming turns off the lights and leaves the room.</p>
<p>Darkness engulfs you again.</p>
<p>You are left alone with your thoughts.</p>

<p><em>He sees humans as lesser beings and he harvests them for food.</em></p>
<p><em>Just like how humans harvest factory-farm animals for food.</em></p>
<p>Your consciousness starts to fade. Lethargy sets in.</p>
<p><em>But I am a human… humans are not supposed to be factory-farmed for food.</em></p>
